# BMI6018_IMDB_Ratings_Prediction_TensorFlow

Predicting movie ratings based on movie metadata obtained from IMDB APIs containing social media attributes and posters information.

Used Tensor Flow and Neural Network techniques to implement the models.

Libraries required:

Keras
Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of MXNet, Deeplearning4j, Tensorflow, CNTK or Theano. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being minimal, modular and extensible.

Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.

Numpy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things: a powerful N-dimensional array object. sophisticated (broadcasting) functions.

Pandas
pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
